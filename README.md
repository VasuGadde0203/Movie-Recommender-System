1. Features
  Content-based recommendation based on movie descriptions and metadata.
  Utilizes natural language processing to calculate similarity between movies.
  Predicts similar movies based on a user's chosen movie.
  Efficient handling of large datasets with movie metadata.
  Easy-to-use interface for recommending movies based on user preferences.

2. Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

  1) Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommender-System.git
    cd Movie-Recommender-System
  2) Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Usage
To use the recommender system:

  1) Run the recommender system:
     python src/app.py
  2) Enter a movie name or select from the list in the user interface.
  3) Get recommended movies based on the movie's plot description and metadata similarity.

4. Technologies Used
  Python: Programming language for building the core logic and recommendation engine.
  Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  Scikit-learn: For implementing the machine learning models.
  Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): For text processing and similarity computations.
  Streamlit: (Optional) To build a web interface for the recommender system.
  Git LFS: For managing large files like the similarity.pkl file.

5. Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains movie metadata and user ratings. Some of the key files are:

tmdb_5000_movies.csv: Contains metadata about movies such as title, genres, and overview.
tmdb_5000_credits.csv: Contains information about cast and crew.

6. Model
This recommender system uses a content-based filtering technique that focuses on movie metadata (e.g., genre, cast, director) and plot descriptions to recommend similar movies.

  Cosine Similarity: Used to calculate similarity between the movies' descriptions.
  TF-IDF Vectorizer: Used to convert textual movie descriptions into numerical vectors for similarity calculation.

 7. Results
The system efficiently recommends movies similar to the one provided by the user. The similarity is calculated based on metadata and textual descriptions, providing a reliable list of recommendations.

Sample output:

Input: "The Dark Knight"
Recommended Movies:

Batman Begins
The Dark Knight Rises
Inception
Iron Man
Spider-Man 3
